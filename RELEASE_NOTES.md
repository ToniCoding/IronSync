> *v1.1.0 â€“ Data Persistence & Exercise Overhaul*

### Added
- Created a new directory named `user_data` to store workout sessions and user-related data.
- Added `WorkoutDTO`, a dedicated Data Transfer Object for encapsulating workout data to be serialized into JSON.
- Implemented `JsonSerializer`, a utility class responsible for converting DTOs into properly structured JSON.
- Added a method to serialize and persist workout data into a JSON file inside the `user_data` directory.
- Added helpers package.
- Added `ExerciseManager` file in charge of converting friendly exercise names from user to internal identifiers.
- Added two more options to get the time and date in `ParseDate`.
- Added "Pending" and "Known issues" sections to README.

### Fixed
- Corrected `createStorageFile` logic to properly check whether the `user_data` directory is being created successfully.
- Fixed `Workout` constructor length checks, which were previously validating incorrect character limits.
- Resolved a bug where attempting to register an additional exercise could throw an exception.
- Fixed a bug in createNewWorkoutEntry that caused the input for a new exercise not to be sanitized if the user previously entered an exercise that already existed.
- Fixed a bug that was setting the time field to null instead of the corresponding time.

### Changed
- Updated the constant `USER_WORKOUT_DATA_PATH` in `AppConstants` to reflect the new `user_data` directory.
- Replaced `FileWriter` with `BufferedWriter` in `writeToFile` for improved I/O efficiency.
- Updated `build.gradle` to mark the `java` directory as the source root instead of `src`.
- The number of sets is now automatically derived from the repetitions input; users no longer input sets manually.
- Refactored `UserController.createNewWorkout` to handle workout entry creation internally, improving clarity in `Main`.
- Moved exercise registration logic into `UserController` for better cohesion.
- Updated `README.md` and `.gitignore` accordingly.
- Minor changes to `FileManager`.
- Refactor of the method used to get the date, time and datetime to be more clear. New name: `getCurrentDateAndTimeFormatted`.
- Refactor of `createNewWorkoutEntry` to avoid variable re-assignation and consistent data about the exercise.
- `WorkoutDTO` now returns the workout ending date.
- `Workout` cascade now accepts time as an argument.

### Removed
- Removed the deprecated method `registered_data` in `FileManager`.
- Removed `ObjectUtils` class.
- Removed duplicated method to normalize user input in `UserController`.

### Known issues
- Normalize friendly exercises name does not work with multiple word exercises.

### Pending tasks
- Refactor code to inject dependencies (like builder/controller classes) via constructor or arguments instead of direct instantiation with `new`, to improve modularity and testability.

# Versioning system

###### *Revised: 09-08-2025*

### What does the version numbers mean?
Version identification consists of three different numbers separated by dots, following the  Semantic Versioning (SemVer) convention: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

### What is taken into account for each version?

##### Major
A major version completely overhaul the application as a whole or adds a very big update to the software.

##### Minor
A minor version brings a new functionality or updates some old functionality.

##### Patch
A path will only fix a bug or an error happening. 

### Examples for major, minor and patch versions
- Major - Software core, adding UI, changing the behaviour of several of the most important functionality of the software.
- Minor - New contents, new behaviours, database implementations.
- Patch - Fixing texts, bugs and small changes.
